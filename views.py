    flask.ext.restless.views
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Provides the following view classes, subclasses of
    :class:`flask.MethodView` which provide generic endpoints for interacting
    with an entity of the database:

    :class:`flask.ext.restless.views.API`
      Provides the endpoints for each of the basic HTTP methods. This is the
      main class used by the
      :meth:`flask.ext.restless.manager.APIManager.create_api` method to create
      endpoints.

    :class:`flask.ext.restless.views.FunctionAPI`
      Provides a :http:method:`get` endpoint which returns the result of
      evaluating some function on the entire collection of a given model.

        model for which this instance of the class is an API. This model should

        required before clients can successfully make requests. If this keyword
        argument is specified, `authentication_function` must also be
        specified.

        `authentication_function` is a function which accepts no arguments and
        returns ``True`` if and only if a client is authorized to make a
        request on an endpoint.

        Pre-condition (callers must satisfy): if `authentication_required_for`
        is specified, so must `authentication_function`.

        `validation_exceptions` is the tuple of exceptions raised by backend
        validation (if any exist). If exceptions are specified here, any
        exceptions which are caught when writing to the database. Will be
        returned to the client as a :http:statuscode:`400` response with a
        message specifying the validation error which occurred. For more
        information, see :ref:`validation`.

        If either `include_columns` or `exclude_columns` is not ``None``,
        exactly one of them must be specified. If both are not ``None``, then
        the behavior of this function is undefined. `exclude_columns` must be
        an iterable of strings specifying the columns of `model` which will
        *not* be present in the JSON representation of the model provided in
        response to :http:method:`get` requests.  Similarly, `include_columns`
        specifies the *only* columns which will be present in the returned
        dictionary. In other words, `exclude_columns` is a blacklist and
        `include_columns` is a whitelist; you can only use one of them per API
        endpoint. If either `include_columns` or `exclude_columns` contains a
        string which does not name a column in `model`, it will be ignored.

        If `include_columns` is an iterable of length zero (like the empty
        tuple or the empty list), then the returned dictionary will be
        empty. If `include_columns` is ``None``, then the returned dictionary
        will include all columns not excluded by `exclude_columns`.

        See :ref:`includes` for information on specifying included or excluded
        columns on fields of related models.

        `results_per_page` is a positive integer which represents the default
        number of results which are returned per page. Requests made by clients
        may override this default by specifying ``results_per_page`` as a query
        argument. `max_results_per_page` is a positive integer which represents
        the maximum number of results which are returned per page. This is a
        "hard" upper bound in the sense that even if a client specifies that
        greater than `max_results_per_page` should be returned, only
        `max_results_per_page` results will be returned. For more information,
        see :ref:`serverpagination`.

           looks like this::

               manager.create_api(Person, post_form_preprocessor=foo)

           with code that looks like this::

               manager.create_api(Person, preprocessors=dict(POST=[foo]))

           See :ref:`processors` for more information and examples.

        `post_form_preprocessor` is a callback function which takes
        POST input parameters loaded from JSON and enhances them with other
        key/value pairs. The example use of this is when your ``model``
        requires to store user identity and for security reasons the identity
        is not read from the post parameters (where malicious user can tamper
        with them) but from the session.

        `preprocessors` is a dictionary mapping strings to lists of
        functions. Each key is the name of an HTTP method (for example,
        ``'GET'`` or ``'POST'``). Each value is a list of functions, each of
        which will be called before any other code is executed when this API
        receives the corresponding HTTP request. The functions will be called
        in the order given here. The `postprocessors` keyword argument is
        essentially the same, except the given functions are called after all
        other code. For more information on preprocessors and postprocessors,
        see :ref:`processors`.

        response will be the JSON string ``{"objects": []}``.

        To search for entities meeting some criteria, the client makes a
        request to :http:get:`/api/<modelname>` with a query string containing
        the parameters of the search. The parameters of the search can involve
        filters. In a filter, the client specifies the name of the field by
        which to filter, the operation to perform on the field, and the value
        which is the argument to that operation. In a function, the client
        specifies the name of a SQL function which is executed on the search
        results; the result of executing the function is returned to the
        client.

        The parameters of the search must be provided in JSON form as the value
        of the ``q`` request query parameter. For example, in a database of
        people, to search for all people with a name containing a "y", the

        query parameter as follows::

           {"objects": [{"name": "Mary"}, {"name": "Byron"}, ...]}

        If the result of the search is a single instance of the model, the JSON
        representation of that instance would be the top-level object in the
        content of the response::
